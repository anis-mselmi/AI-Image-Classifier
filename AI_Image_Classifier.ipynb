        "# Project Overview: Image Classification of Fruits\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Project Purpose\n",
        "This project aims to build a basic image classification system capable of distinguishing between images of apples, bananas, and oranges. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of setting up an image classification project, from data generation and model training to evaluation and prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. How Training Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process involves the following steps:\n",
        "1.  **Dataset Preparation**: Synthetic images for 'apple', 'banana', and 'orange' are generated and saved into their respective directories within `project/dataset/`. These images serve as the training data.\n",
        "2.  **Data Loading**: TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` is used to load images from the dataset directories, apply data augmentation (if specified), and create batches for training and validation.\n",
        "3.  **Model Architecture**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed using Keras. This model typically includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification.\n",
        "4.  **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).\n",
        "5.  **Model Training**: The compiled model is trained on the prepared dataset for a specified number of epochs. During training, the model learns to identify patterns and features unique to each fruit class.\n",
        "6.  **Model Saving**: After training, the best-performing model (or the model after a fixed number of epochs) is saved to the `project/models/model.h5` file for future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. How to Add New Classes\n",
        "\n",
        "To add new image classes to the project, follow these steps:\n",
        "1.  **Create a New Directory**: Inside the `project/dataset/` directory, create a new subdirectory named after your new class (e.g., `project/dataset/strawberry`).\n",
        "2.  **Populate with Images**: Place a sufficient number of images for the new class into this newly created directory. Ensure images are diverse and representative of the class.\n",
        "3.  **Adjust Data Generator**: If using `ImageDataGenerator`, it will automatically detect the new directory as a new class. However, you might need to re-run the data loading step.\n",
        "4.  **Retrain the Model**: The model will need to be retrained on the updated dataset. This will involve re-running the model building, compilation, and training steps. You might also need to adjust the output layer of the CNN to match the new number of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. How to Test the Model\n",
        "\n",
        "To test the trained model, you can:\n",
        "1.  **Load the Saved Model**: Load the `model.h5` file from the `project/models/` directory using `tf.keras.models.load_model()`.\n",
        "2.  **Prepare a Test Image**: Provide a new image that the model has not seen before. This image should be preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model (e.g., resizing, normalization).\n",
        "3.  **Make a Prediction**: Use the loaded model's `predict()` method on the prepared test image. The model will output probabilities for each class.\n",
        "4.  **Interpret Results**: The class with the highest probability is the model's prediction. The project includes a prediction script that automates this process, prompting the user for an image and displaying the predicted class.\n",

        "*   An `overview.md` file was generated, detailing the project's purpose, training workflow, how to add new classes, and model testing procedures.\n",
        "*   Three distinct sample images (one for 'apple', 'banana', and 'orange') were programmatically created using PIL and saved to their respective dataset directories.\n",
        "*   A TensorFlow `ImageDataGenerator` successfully loaded the dataset, identifying 3 images belonging to 3 classes (apple, banana, orange) and preparing them for model training with 128x128 pixel target size and rescaling to `[0, 1]`.\n",
        "*   A small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was built, compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical\\_crossentropy' loss, and trained for 5 epochs.\n",
        "*   The trained model was successfully saved as `project/models/model.h5`.\n",
        "*   Plots visualizing training accuracy and loss were generated and saved as PNG files in the `project/results/` directory.\n",

For more robust model training, the next step should involve using a diverse, real-world image dataset with more variability within each class, or implementing more sophisticated synthetic image generation techniques.\n",
        "*   Given the successful basic image classification pipeline, further improvements could include evaluating the model on a separate validation set, implementing data augmentation during training, and exploring more complex CNN architectures to improve prediction accuracy with a larger, more varied dataset.\n"
